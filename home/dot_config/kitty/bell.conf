#: The visual bell duration (in seconds). Flash the screen when a bell
#: occurs for the specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.
#: The flash is animated, fading in and out over the specified
#: duration. The easing function used for the fading can be
#: controlled. For example, 2.0 linear will casuse the flash to fade
#: in and out linearly. The default if unspecified is to use ease-in-
#: out which fades slowly at the start, middle and end. You can
#: specify different easing functions for the fade-in and fade-out
#: parts, like this: 2.0 ease-in linear. kitty supports all the CSS
#: easing functions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
#: US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function>.

#: For backwards compatibility, values of yes, y and true are
#: converted to the default bell symbol and no, n, false and none are
#: converted to the empty string.

#: The XDG Sound Theme kitty will use to play the bell sound. Defaults

#: freedesktop theme if it does not exist. To change your sound theme

#: :file:~/.local/share/sounds/__custom/index.theme` with the
#: contents:
#:     [Sound Theme]
#:     Inherits=name-of-the-sound-theme-you-want-to-use

#: theme name. Now all compliant applications should use sounds from
#: this theme.
