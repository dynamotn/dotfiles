# The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
# whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
# Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
# --login to ensure that the shell starts in interactive mode and
# reads its startup rc files.
shell .

# The console editor to use when editing the kitty config file or
# similar tasks. A value of . means to use the environment variable
# EDITOR. Note that this environment variable has to be set not just
# in your shell startup scripts but system-wide, otherwise kitty will
# not see it.
editor .

# Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. If no (the
# default), the terminal will remain open when the child exits as
# long as there are still processes outputting to the terminal (for
# example disowned or backgrounded processes). If yes, the window
# will close as soon as the child process exits. Note that setting it
# to yes means that any background processes still using the terminal
# can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.
close_on_child_death no

# Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
# programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
# to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
# content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over ssh
# connections.
allow_remote_control no

# Tell kitty to listen to the specified unix/tcp socket for remote
# control connections. Note that this will apply to all kitty
# instances. It can be overridden by the kitty --listen-on command
# line flag. This option accepts only UNIX sockets, such as
# unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or (on Linux) unix:@mykitty. Environment
# variables are expanded. If {kitty_pid} is present then it is
# replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the PID of the
# kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen. This option
# is ignored unless you also set allow_remote_control to enable
# remote control. See the help for kitty --listen-on for more
# details.
listen_on none

# Specify environment variables to set in all child processes. Note
# that environment variables are expanded recursively, so if you
# use::
#     env MYVAR1=a
#     env MYVAR2=${MYVAR1}/${HOME}/b

# Periodically check if an update to kitty is available. If an update
# is found a system notification is displayed informing you of the
# available update. The default is to check every 24 hrs, set to zero
# to disable.
update_check_interval 0

# Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
# overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
# individual instances. See
# https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html#sessions in the kitty
# documentation for details. Note that relative paths are interpreted
# with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment variables
# in the path are expanded.
startup_session none

# Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
# clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
# set of possible actions is: write-clipboard read-clipboard write-
# primary read-primary The default is to allow writing to the
# clipboard and primary selection. Note that enabling the read
# functionality is a security risk as it means that any program, even
# one running on a remote server via SSH can read your clipboard.
clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary

# Process hyperlink (OSC 8) escape sequences. If disabled OSC 8
# escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
# links, that you can click by holding down ctrl+shift and clicking
# with the mouse. The special value of ``ask`` means that kitty will
# ask before opening the link.
allow_hyperlinks yes

# The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
# can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
# you are doing, not because you read some advice on Stack Overflow
# to change it. The TERM variable if used by various programs to get
# information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
# you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
# different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
# from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
# work.
